Hi,
i'm Flo and I study Computer Science in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. On this Github Account I put some small Projects that i have done in the past. The only one that i am still working on is the Concert App. 

I had always trouble finding small Concert that are not listed at any majour event sites. That is why I decided to start developing a web app where users can insert/promote their own small concerts and parties, while everyone can easily search for concerts, filter them by location or genre etc.
I have just started to develope that project and I use it mostly to learn stuff. So don't expect clean and highly performant code. 

Besides programming, my biggest hobbies are climbing, meeting friends and reading.
